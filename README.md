# Indian-Liver-Diseases

Indian Liver Disease Analysis and Prediction
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of liver disease using the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD). Liver diseases are a significant health concern in India, affecting millions of individuals annually. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, this project aims to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and develop predictive models to assist in early diagnosis and better management of liver-related conditions.

Key Features:
Dataset Exploration: Analysis of the Indian Liver Patient Dataset, which contains patient demographics, biochemical test results, and disease outcomes.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for machine learning models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset to identify significant features influencing liver health.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others to predict liver disease.
Evaluation Metrics: Use of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Insights for Healthcare: Key findings and patterns that can aid healthcare professionals in better understanding and managing liver diseases.
Goals:
Provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to liver disease in Indian patients.
Develop robust predictive models to classify patients as liver disease-positive or negative.
Empower healthcare providers with data-driven insights for early diagnosis and treatment planning.
Applications:
Clinical Decision Support: Assisting doctors in identifying at-risk patients.
Public Health: Informing health policies by understanding prevalence and risk factors.
Medical Research: Offering insights into liver disease trends specific to the Indian population.
Technologies Used:
Python: For data processing, visualization, and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: For dataset manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Deliverables:
A detailed Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and results.
Visualizations to highlight key patterns in the dataset.
Machine learning models ready for deployment in a healthcare setting.
